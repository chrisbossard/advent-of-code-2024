# Advent of Code 2024 🎄

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a series of daily programming challenges during December. Each solution is written in Python.

## Structure
- Each day's challenge is in its own folder (`Day01`, `Day02`, etc.).
- Each folder contains:
  - `data.txt`: Puzzle input for that day.
  - `dayx.py`: My solution to the puzzle.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrisbossard/advent-of-code-2024.git

2. Navigate to a specific day's folder
    ```bash 
    cd Day01

3. Run the solution:
    ```bash
    python day1.py
